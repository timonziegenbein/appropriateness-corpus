Just one.\\r\\nI have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.\\r\\nOnce you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument).\\r\\nOnce you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity.\\r\\nOnce you have done this, disprove all other religions.\\r\\n-\\r\\nUntil such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.   \n",
